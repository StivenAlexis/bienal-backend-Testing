## Project Overview

This is the backend for the Bienal project for the year of 2024.

This project is part of another project that focuses on creating a Progressive Web Application (PWA) to manage and visualize events related to sculptors and sculptures. Through the platform, administrators will be able to add, modify, delete, and query detailed information about past and future events, sculptors, and sculptures. Meanwhile, public site users will have access to a voting system for sculptures, with authentication through social media.

Key features include:
- Event management (past and future)
- Sculptor and sculpture information database
- Administrative interface for CRUD operations
- Public interface for viewing events and sculptures
- Voting system for sculptures
- Social media authentication for public users

The backend provides the necessary API endpoints and data management to support these features, ensuring a seamless experience for both administrators and public users.

It includes the API for the web app developed to be deployed through microservices.

- microservices:
  - validation
  - management
